<h1>Top 10 Best Movies according to Ruhan</h1>
<h2>My all time favourite movies ranked.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>All time favourite of mine. Loved every single frame of it.<br/>"Where are the kids," wasn't it the moment our hearts skipped a beat?
</p>
<h3>Predestination</h3>
<p>Goshhhhh, the Predestination Paradox!!! Ethan Hawk's the reason I watched it. Don't regret this decision.<br/>What are you? Jane Doe? John Doe?</p>
<h3>The Lobster</h3>
<p>Dark comedy. Obsessed.<br>The whole movie is a metaphor. One of the themes is the societal pressure we all face. Somewhere, this societal pressure is the reason I'm learning Web Development at the moment.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>My comfort movie. We all love Studio Ghibli for our own reasons.</p>
<h3>The Prestige</h3><p>One of the Nolan movies which need to be appreciated more than they really are.</p> <h3>Jojo Rabbit</h3>
<p>My comfort movie.<br>Why was der Fuhrer racially inaccurate, by the way?</p>

<h3>The Pianist</h3>
<p>Heartbreaking beyond repair.<br>I wouldn't wanna watch it again, and still won't stop thinking about it.</p><h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>Work of art. Do I need to say more?</p>
<h3>Incendies</h3>
<p>One of those uncomfortable movies to watch. <br>"Can 1+1 be equal to 1?"</p>
<h3>Porco Ross</h3>
<p>Ahh, a classic!<br>"I'd rather be a pig than a fascist." Need I say more?</p>
